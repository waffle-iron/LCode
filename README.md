# LCode
When Javascript meets Lambda expressions

## How to test this?

Open the `.pegjs` file, copy the contents, go to http://pegjs.org/online,
paste it into the grammar text box, test your LCode in the input text box,
and then viola!

Note: If the translated code is a bit too crazy, have it *beautified* at http://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home
